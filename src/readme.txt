Create viral content with this Buzzfeed style personality quiz!

== Description ==

Increase your social media traffic with personality quizzes! ("Which ____ are you? Take this quiz and find out!" You know the drill.)
They've been wildly popular for nearly a decade now and show no signs of going away any time soon.

Because this quiz plugin is an [editor block](https://wordpress.com/support/wordpress-editor/), adding a quiz to your
post is as easy as adding another paragraph! You can even have multiple quizzes per post. Pretty slick, huh?
