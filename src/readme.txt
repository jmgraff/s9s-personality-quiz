== Description ==

Increase your social media traffic with personality quizzes! ("Which
____ are you? Take this quiz and find out!" You know the drill.) They've
been wildly popular for nearly a decade now and show no signs of going
away any time soon.

Because this quiz plugin is an
[editor block](https://wordpress.com/support/wordpress-editor/), adding
a quiz to your post is as easy as adding another paragraph! You can even
have multiple quizzes per post. Pretty slick, huh?

Cool features:
*   Easy *editor block* interface
*   Unlimited questions, answers, and results
*   Multiple quizzes per page (and post!)
*   Minimal styling - blends in with *your* theme
*   More to come in future releases!
